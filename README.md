# What the machine saw 

Playing around with the computer vision tags on the [Science Museum Group Collection](http://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk). The tags were generated using AWS's [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/) service. Built using the Science Museum's [Collection Online API](https://github.com/TheScienceMuseum/collectionsonline/wiki/Collections-Online-API).
