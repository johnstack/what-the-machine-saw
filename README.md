# What the machine saw 

A [web page](https://johnstack.github.io/what-the-machine-saw/index.html) exploring the computer vision tags on the [Science Museum Group Collection](http://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk). The tags were generated using AWS's [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/) service.
